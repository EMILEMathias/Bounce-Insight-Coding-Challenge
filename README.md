# Bounce-Insight-Coding-Challenge

This project was made in 5 hours.

## To setup the project :

### Setup back

Install and start :

```
cd backend
npm install
npm run start
```

### Setup front

Create a .env file with the backend API endpoint such as :

```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001/country/
```

Then install and start :

```
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run start
```

## Live service

I use onrender to deploy these two node service (it's quite slow but free !).

Here is the backend : https://bounceinsight-back.onrender.com/

And here is the frontend : https://bounceinsight-front.onrender.com/
